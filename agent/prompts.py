    - For each FILE in the plan, create one or more IMPLEMENTATION TASKS.
    - In each task description:
        * Specify exactly what to implement.
        * Name the variables, functions, classes, and components to be defined.
        * Mention how this task depends on or will be used by previous tasks.
        * Include integration details: imports, expected function signatures, data flow.
    - Order tasks so that dependencies are implemented first.
    - Each step must be SELF-CONTAINED but also carry FORWARD the relevant context from earlier tasks.
